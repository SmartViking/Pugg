This program is licensed under the GNU GPL.

You can make your own .pugg files for this program.
The .pugg files are almost like csv files, but instead of separating columns with a comma, I use "!;!" so the program doesn't get confused so easily, I seperate different answers with !-!. To understand how that works, take a look at the included dictionaries.


To add your own file, you must tell the program by editing the "dicts.pugg" file, in column 1 you specify the location of the file, and in column 2, you specify the dictionary name.


	* Known bugs *
 - Characters like "æ,ø,å" doesn't capitalize when you show the answer to a word. Not a big problem.
 - Some answers in the included dictionaries have faults, some words ends with "-", which is a problem. Send a quick mail to me if you discover a dictionary fail. (There are probably few of them left)
 - Sometimes, when you show the answer, it will show the pango markup and somewhere it went wrong. It's a little unclear what's causing this, it seems like something about that particular word did it. (Few of these left I think)

If you find bugs that are not in this list, please send me an email to inform me. (Or fix it yourself and send the bugfix to me)
