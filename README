This program is licensed under the GNU GPL.

You can make your own .pugg files for this program.
The .pugg files are almost like csv files, but instead of separating columns with a comma, I use "!;!" so the program doesn't get confused so easily, I seperate different answers with !-!. To understand how that works, take a look at the included dictionaries.


To add your own file, you must tell the program by editing the "dicts.pugg" file, in column 1 you specify the location of the file, and in column 2, you specify the dictionary name.

Any contributions are welcome.
